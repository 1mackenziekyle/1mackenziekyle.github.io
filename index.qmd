# Welcome

I'm Kyle Mackenzie, a fifth-year Engineering Physics student at the University of British Columbia. 

# Academics 

I am currently working with [Sasha Fedorova](https://ece.ubc.ca/alexandra-sasha-fedorova/) out of the Computer and Software Systems research group at UBC, on a memory pre-fetching algorithm using novel machine-learning techniques. 

My course work includes a mix  mix of multi-disciplinary engineering topics, with a focus on high-level mathematics and physics. I have supplemented my studies with a specialization in 
software and computer systems by choosing technical elective courses in computer engineering. 


# Projects 

I have a mix of experience with projects including working on torque controls for [UBC Formula Electric](./01_fsae.qmd), developing the [OS161 operating system](./02_os.qmd), and my [Capstone project](./03_learning-to-balance.qmd). Check them out on the other tabs of this website!
