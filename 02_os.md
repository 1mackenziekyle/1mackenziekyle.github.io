# OS161 Operating System 
*Sept. 2024 - Present* 

I am taking the course CPEN 331 at UBC, an Operating Systems course, in which I am writing OS-level code to add to the educational OS/161 from Harvard's CS161 course. So far, I have implemented synchronization primitive types for multi-threaded programming, and implemented the filetable system, which manages the synchronized access to files between processes. 

#### Synchronization

I used synchronization primitives (namely spinlocks) to implement higher-level primitives to aid in writing concurrent multi-threaded code for a multi-core machine, including higher-level locks, semaphores, and condition variables.

These synchronization tools were then tested using unit tests that spawned hundreds of threads, and manipulated shared data safely.

#### Syscalls - File Management



I implemented the syscalls that linux uses to modify files: `open()`, `close()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `lseek()`. These syscalls required the implementation of a system-wide data structure that tracks open and closed files, and manages the shared access to them between processes. We followed the standard Unix file system structure with a few small modifications.

#### Syscalls - process creation

I implemented the syscalls `fork()` and `execv()`, which are used to create new processes in the kernel. 

###### `fork()`: Spawn an identical copy of the current running process

Required the current process' address space (the sections of memory that it, alone, has access to) to be copied to the new process in a way that left no duplicate pointers. The way we did this was by copying all of the contents of the parent process' physical pages onto a set of newly allocated physical pages, and adjusting the address space' pointers such that any translated virtual addresses in the new (child) process would point to these newly allocated copies

###### `execv()`: Replace the current running program with a new one.

It required a careful management of kernel memory, while being able to copy up to 64KB of memory from the old address space to the new. We decided on a chunking strategy, where we allocate space on the new user 
stack, and copy a single kilobyte of memory over at a time. This strategy allows the kernel to stay lean, and reduce the amount of pages required by the kernel on a standard machine, which is a large benefit
in real-world kernel design.
