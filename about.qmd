Some of my interests outside of academics include playing the guitar, scuba diving, and 
running. 

I ran a marathon in October 2024, in the middle of the school semester. It was a huge challenge to train 
during the school semester, but it ended up being immensely rewarding to finish the full marathon. I will be 
running again to beat my time!
